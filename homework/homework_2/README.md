1. Extend the FSM-based string matching algorithm to print all the occurrences of the pattern in a text.

2. Modify the FSM-based string matching algorithm to be case-insensitive.

3. Modify the FSM construction in stirng matching algorithm to recognize '.' wildcard matching any character.

4. **Write the algorithm of the FSM construction for stirng matching recognizing '?' matching preceding character 1 or 0 times.
