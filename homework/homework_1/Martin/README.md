Homework1 consists of only the first problem:
   
    ```
    double cubeRoot(double x, double delta);
    double sine(double x, double delta); -> unfinished, requires more work
    ```

Homework2 is the combination of 2nd, 3rd and 4th problems:
    
    ```
    bool isPrime(int); -> later written as a return value of a pair(bool, std::vector<int>)
    std::vector<int> primeFactorize(int);
    int computeGCD(int a, int b);
    int computeLCM(int a, int b);
    ```

Homework3 is only the implementation of the 5th problem:
    ```
    int computeGCD(int a, int b); -> with euclid's method
    int computeLCM(int a, int b);
    ```
